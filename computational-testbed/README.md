# Complexity Functionals on Sparse Random Graphs  
(exploratory-v1)

**Pure applied-mathematics / network-science testbed**  
No physical claims of any kind are made.

**New figure with error bars + weight sensitivity:**

**Directory structure:**
- `src/` — core functions (C(G) with sensitivity, graph generators)
- `experiments/` — scaling + stability tests (with error bars)
- `notebooks/` — one-click reproduction script
- `plots/` — all figures
- `data/` — (for future raw results)

**One-click reproduction:**
```bash
cd computational-testbed
python notebooks/exploratory.py

The microscopic dynamics and complexity functional used in this work build on the computational testbed developed in the companion paper [Aftab, 2026b], available at https://github.com/syedrazaaftab/IET-Emergence/tree/computational-v1/computational-testbed.
